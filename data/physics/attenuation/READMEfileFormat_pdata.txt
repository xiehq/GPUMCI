Each file in this directory represents a single material.

Each file is downloaded from NIST XCOM, with all optional columns checked.
Consequently,
   the first   column is the energy in MeV;
   the second  column is the mass attenuation coefficient for coherent (Rayleigh) scattering;
   the third   column is the mass attenuation coefficient for in coherent (Compton) scattering;
   the fourth  column is the mass attenuation coefficient for photoelectric absorption;
   the fifth   column is the mass attenuation coefficient for pair production in the nuclear field;
   the sixth   column is the mass attenuation coefficient for pair production in the electron field;
   the seventh column is the total mass attenuation coefficient with coherent scattering;
   the eighth  column is the total mass attenuation coefficient without coherent scattering.

All mass attenuation coefficients are in units of cm^2 / g.
