Integration tests and examples of the python bindings

Usage
--------------------
To run these tests the Python bindings have to be built and installed.

##### Windows
Set up the project with python and numpy. Build GPUMCIPy and install by building PyInstall.

##### Linux
Make as usual, then `make PyInstall`.

Tests
--------------------
The subfolder test contains some regression tests, these verify that the result is the same each time the program is run.
